Here’s a sample README.md for your Real-Time Weather Monitoring System built with Spring Boot. It provides an overview of the project, setup instructions, and how to use the application.

Real-Time Weather Monitoring System
Overview
This project is a real-time weather monitoring system that retrieves data from the OpenWeatherMap API, processes it, and provides daily summaries of the weather for specified cities in India. The system stores weather data, aggregates it for daily summaries, triggers alerts for specific conditions, and offers visualizations.

Key Features:
Fetches weather data from OpenWeatherMap for specified cities (Delhi, Mumbai, Chennai, Bangalore, Kolkata, Hyderabad).
Converts temperatures from Kelvin to Celsius.
Provides daily weather summaries including:
Average temperature
Maximum temperature
Minimum temperature
Dominant weather condition
Configurable alerts for thresholds (e.g., temperature exceeding 35°C for two consecutive updates).
Visualizes historical trends and daily summaries (optional).
Technologies
Java 11 or higher
Spring Boot 3.x (REST, Scheduling, JPA)
H2 Database (or replaceable with MySQL/PostgreSQL)
Thymeleaf and Chart.js (for optional visualizations)
RestTemplate or WebClient (for API calls)
Setup Instructions
Prerequisites
Java 11 or higher.
Maven (for dependency management).
API Key from OpenWeatherMap.
Sign up and get a free API key.
Getting Started
Clone the Repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-username/weather-monitoring-system.git
cd weather-monitoring-system
Set Up API Key and Configurations: Open the src/main/resources/application.properties file and add your API key and configurations:

properties
Copy code
weather.api.url=https://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/weather
weather.api.key=YOUR_API_KEY
weather.cities=Delhi,Mumbai,Chennai,Bangalore,Kolkata,Hyderabad
weather.update.interval=300000  # Fetch interval in milliseconds (e.g., 5 minutes)
alert.temp.threshold=35  # Set your alert temperature threshold
Build and Run the Application:

bash
Copy code
mvn clean install
mvn spring-boot:run
Access the Application: By default, the application will run at http://localhost:8080.

Functionality
1. Real-Time Weather Retrieval
The system fetches weather data from the OpenWeatherMap API for the specified cities at configurable intervals (e.g., every 5 minutes).

2. Daily Weather Summaries
For each city, the system aggregates the weather data to calculate:

Average temperature
Maximum temperature
Minimum temperature
Dominant weather condition
These summaries are stored in a database (H2 by default) and can be displayed via API endpoints or web views.

3. Temperature and Weather Condition Alerts
You can define thresholds, such as a maximum temperature, to trigger alerts when the weather exceeds the limit for consecutive updates.

Alerts can be logged in the console or extended to send notifications (e.g., via email).
4. Visualizations (Optional)
The system can generate visualizations for daily weather summaries and historical trends using Thymeleaf for rendering and Chart.js for displaying graphs.

API Endpoints
1. Get Daily Summary for a City
GET /api/weather/summary/{city}/{date}
Retrieves the daily weather summary for the given city and date.
json
Copy code
{
  "avgTemperature": 28.5,
  "maxTemperature": 32.1,
  "minTemperature": 24.0,
  "dominantCondition": "Clear"
}
2. Check Weather Alert Status
GET /api/weather/alerts/{city}
Checks if there are any active alerts for the specified city.
3. Historical Weather Data
GET /api/weather/history/{city}/{startDate}/{endDate}
Fetches the historical weather data for a city between the specified dates.
Testing
Running Unit Tests
The project includes basic unit tests to ensure that the weather retrieval, temperature conversion, and alert systems work as expected. To run the tests:

bash
mvn test

Customization
1. Adding More Cities
To add more cities, simply update the weather.cities property in application.properties with a comma-separated list of city names.
2. Database Configuration
The default database is H2 (in-memory). You can switch to a persistent database like MySQL or PostgreSQL by updating the database configurations in application.properties.
3. Extend Weather Parameters
You can extend the system to support additional weather parameters from OpenWeatherMap (e.g., humidity, wind speed) by modifying the WeatherData entity and updating the API parsing logic.
Future Enhancements
Email or SMS notifications for weather alerts.
Forecast-based summaries to show upcoming weather trends.
User preferences for selecting cities or setting specific weather conditions for alerts.
Improved visualizations with more interactive charts.
